# messenger-counter

download your messenger data as a **JSON** file through a facebook request. 

put the latest version file (version #, not commit date since i uploaded some stuff in the wrong order) in the inbox folder 
  file path should look like: (name)\messages\inbox\fbv#.py

run the python file with something that has the modules (conda is the easiest way to do it) and it should:
  1. rename the folders with the conversions to readable text (remove the identifiers after the name)
  2. display a couple of graphs with statisical data about your convos with that person
  
if you don't want to deal with conda/want to send to a friend who doesn't have it here's exe version that has all the modules in it so you don't have to do any setup other than placing it in the right file directory (its too big for github)

  also ^ is far less likely to get updated compared to the py files
