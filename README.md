# messenger-counter

download your messenger data as a **JSON** file through a facebook request. 

put the latest version file (version #, not commit date since i uploaded some stuff in the wrong order) in the inbox folder 
  file path should look like: (name)\messages\inbox\fbv#.py

run the python file with something that has the modules (conda is the easiest way to do it) and it should:
  1. rename the folders with the conversions to readable text (remove the identifiers after the name)
  2. display a couple of graphs with statisical data about your convos with that person
